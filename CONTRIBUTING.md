* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug üêõ

Using **pewanalytics** and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. macOS 10.13.6).
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

#### Development guidelines

We try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development, and we use Python docstrings and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to document all of our code. 

1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.
3. Make your changes:
    * Write your code.
    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    * Document your code (see function documentation above).
4. If you added unit tests, make sure everything works by running the `python -m unittest tests` command from the root directory of the repository. 
5. If you added or updated documentation, build a fresh version of the docs by running the `make github` command from the root directory of the repository.
6. Commit and push your changes.
7. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).
